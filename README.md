# AUTO ML WEB APP

This is my project on Automatic machine learning Web application which makes machine learning easy and fantastic.





## Features of this Project

One of the main motos of this project is people often tend to select a best algorithm for their machine learning projects but failing to select an algorithm which performs good on their data as each algorithm has special working and features of their own.So this AUTO ML WEB APP will help them with selecting best algorithm for their project.

I created this AUTO ML WEB APP with Streamlit framework as its user friendly and with few features that are mentioned below,

1. You can upload your data set and can view the data within the web app itself.

2. This web app has EDA section which provides 3 different options for analysing your data. [Pandas-Profiling , Sweet-viz ,D-Tale].

3. In this web app we can perform automatic machine learning models on both Regression and Classification.

4. Data cleaning , labelling and transformation is done automatically by the webapp itself.

5. You can Download the best ML Algorithm from the webapp and you can use it in your model.

Completed my graduation in Engineering in the stream of Electronics and communication with [7.97 CGPA].

My path for Artificial Intelligence started in 2020 where I was attracted to the way it functions. Since then my keen and interest in AI has never been down and wanted to contribute and provide solutions in this domain. For sure in the near future, I will be on my way to contributing and currently working on becoming an Artificial Intelligence Engineer.Seeking to use my skills and knowledge to make a positive impact as a data scientist.

I'm a quick learner and enthusiastic about participating extra curricular activities, with my talent I'm looking for an opportunity to take the next step in my career.

üî≠ I‚Äôm currently working on to improve myself.

üå± I‚Äôm currently learning Python3.

üí¨ Soon in near future ask me about Artificial Intelligence stuffs.
